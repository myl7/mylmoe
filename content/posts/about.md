My name is Yulong Ming in English and 明宇龙 in Chinese.
I use myl7, myl7s, or myl7s1 as my usernames, depending on the username length limits and availability.

I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at City University of Hong Kong (2022-26), interested in Network Security, Applied Cryptography, and Artificial Intelligence Security.

I work on free and open-source software (FOSS) projects, contributing on GitHub.
I do run Arch Linux for my daily work.

## Social Links
